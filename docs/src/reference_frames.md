## Reference Frames

### Introduction
Reference frames are needed for following purposes:
- for creating a CAD model of the wing (or the wings)
- for defining the apparent wind speed vector $v_a$
- for calculating the lift and drag and side force coefficients
- for calculating the resulting forces and moments

### CAD reference frame (CAD)
A geometric model is always created using the CAD reference frame.
It can have any origin (with respect to the kite), but usually either the center of gravity of the body or the bridle point/ Kite Control Unit is used. 

### Kite reference frame (K)
This is a body-fixed reference frame.
