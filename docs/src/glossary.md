| Panel | Flat surface element in 3D that approximate the contour of the aerodynamic body being studied.|
| Section |A wing section, also known as an airfoil or aerofoil, is the cross-sectional shape of an aircraft wing.|
| Span | Distance from one wing tip to the other wing tip. |
| Polar | The polar typically plots the coefficient of lift (CL) against the coefficient of drag (CD), with the angle of attack as a parameter along the curve. |
| Distribution  |Vector of scalars. Length: number of panels.|
| mu $\mu$ | Dynamic viscosity [N·s/m²]  |
| alpha $\alpha$| Angle of attack [rad]|
| beta $\beta$| Trailing edge angle [rad] |
| CL, cl | Lift coefficient [-] |
| CD, cd | Drag coefficient [-] |
| CS, cs | Side force coefficient |
