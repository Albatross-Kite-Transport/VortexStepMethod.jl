|Term   |Explanation   |
|:---|:---|
| VSM| Vortex Step Method|
| LLM| Lifting Line Method|
| Panel | Flat surface element in 3D that approximate the contour of the aerodynamic body being studied.|
| Section |A wing section, also known as an airfoil or aerofoil, is the cross-sectional shape of an aircraft wing.|
| Span | Distance from one wing tip to the other wing tip. |
| Polar | The polar typically plots the coefficient of lift (CL) against the coefficient of drag (CD), with the angle of attack as a parameter along the curve. |
| Distribution  |Vector of scalars. Length: number of panels.|
| mu $\mu$ | Dynamic viscosity [N·s/m²]  |
| alpha $\alpha$| Angle of attack [rad]|
| beta $\beta$| Trailing edge angle [rad] |
| CL, cl | Lift coefficient [-] |
| CD, cd | Drag coefficient [-] |
| CS, cs | Side force coefficient [-] |
| CM, cm | Pitching moment coefficient [-] |
| camber | The camber of a kite refers to the curvature of its airfoil shape. The camber is typically measured as the maximum distance between the mean camber line (the line equidistant from the upper and lower surfaces) and the chord line of the airfoil. |
| chord line | The chord line of an airfoil is an imaginary straight line that connects the leading edge (front) to the trailing edge (back) of the airfoil. |
