## Initial Release
This project is based on version 1.0 of the Python project [Vortex-Step-Method](https://github.com/ocayon/Vortex-Step-Method)

## Noteworthy Differences
- implemented in Julia, therefore about 20 times faster
- an importer for `.obj` wing geometry files was added (see: [#10](https://github.com/Albatross-Kite-Transport/VortexStepMethod.jl/issues/10))
- a ram-air kite example was added
